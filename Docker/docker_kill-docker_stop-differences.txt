docker kill  docker stop  differences

docker stop
Stop a running container by sending SIGTERM and then SIGKILL after a grace period

docker kill
Kill a running container using SIGKILL or a specified signal

docker kill doesn't care if container agrees to shut down right now, it will shut down the container right now.
deep down the 'docker stop' will send SIGNTERM first.
